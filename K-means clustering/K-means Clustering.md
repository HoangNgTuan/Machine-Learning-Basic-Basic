### 1. Introduction

K-Means Clustering is the algorithm of [Unsupervised Learning](https://www.guru99.com/unsupervised-machine-learning.html)\
**Label** of data is unknown. Our purpose is to make those data divide into **Cluster**.  
Each **Cluster** has its own property

**Application**: Divide animals into species

**K-means Clustering** takes part in the process in the midddle
We call the suitable number of clustering 


**Issue 1**: Find Clustering of some data

**Issue**: Find Domain of a Country\
Suppose we have   
&emsp; **Triangle** country <p><input type="image" src="https://image.pngaaa.com/107/59107-middle.png" alt="Yellow Triangle" width="40" height="40"></p>
